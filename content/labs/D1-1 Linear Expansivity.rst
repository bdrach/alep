  :description: Solids expand and contract across their range of temperature -- from near zero to the extreme of their melting points.  This experiment provides practical experience with expansivity of one sample material.

D1-1: Linear Expansivity
========================

Apparatus
---------

Gas burner or a stove; heating stand; steam generator; expansion sample;
small beaker or dish; meter stick; micrometer; thermometer; stack of
books, table of linear expansivities of common materials

|D1-1.1| 

Procedure
---------

1. Set up apparatus as shown above. Be sure the sample slopes away from
   the steam generator, screw #1 is very tight, and screw #3 is very
   loose. Be certain there is water in the steam generator.

2. Loosen screw #2 and push the sliding metal piece up against the leg
   which holds the sample. Tighten screw #2 to lock the sliding metal
   piece in this position. Measure the distance :math:`AB` with a
   micrometer. NOTE: The metal faces at :math:`A` and :math:`B` are not
   perfectly flat or parallel. You must measure :math:`AB` at the very
   edge of the metal pieces and then use the exact same location for all
   future measurements.

3. Measure the length, :math:`L_0`,of the sample. Measure from the
   centers of the tightened screws #1 and #2.

4. Measure the room temperature.

5. Light the gas burner or stove. After steam begins flowing steadily
   through the tube wait 3 minutes and then measure :math:`AB` again.

Observations
------------

:math:`AB` before heating = \_\_\_\_ m, :math:`AB` after heating =
\_\_\_\_ m

:math:`\Delta L` = change in length = \_\_\_\_ m

:math:`L_0` = length of sample between screws 1 and 2 = \_\_\_\_ m  

:math:`\Theta_T` = room temperature = \_\_\_\_\ :math:`^0` C

:math:`\Delta \Theta` = change in temperature of the sample =
\_\_\_\_\ :math:`^0` C  

Theory
------

The coefficient of linear expansion is determined from the relation
:math:`\Delta L = L_0 \alpha \Delta \Theta` where :math:`\alpha` is the
average of the coefficient of linear expansion over the temperature
range.

Analysis
--------

1. What is the coefficient of linear expansion of the sample?

2. What material is the sample? Explain your choice by refering to a
   table of linear expansivities of common materials.

3. List 4 assumptions you made in determining the coefficient for the
   sample. For each assumption justify it or account for error.
