<h1 class="title">About</h1>
<p>This website is based off of <em>Advanced Level Experimental Physics</em>, a textbook
written by Bob Drach and Norman Price during their time teaching together at
the Ruvuma Boy's Secondary School in Songea, Tanzania.   The first edition
was published in 1987.  In 2016, with the help of Max Drach, we published the
current edition as a Github project under a <a class="reference external" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution
License</a>.</p>
<p>Find the Github project at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bdrach/alep">https://github.com/bdrach/alep</a>.  The project folder
includes all the text in a markup language so you can edit and compile it
into a format of your choice.  There is also a folder containing a version
compiled in html -- which is also published on a website hosted at GitHub (will
provide a url -- tbd). Finally, you can find the text compiled as .pdf files
if you want to print or work with the text in this format.</p>
