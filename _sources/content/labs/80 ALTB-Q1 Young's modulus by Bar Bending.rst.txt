80 ALT B-Q1: Young's modulus by Bar Bending
===========================================

Time: :math:`1 \frac{1}{2}` hr.

Apparatus
---------

Wooden bar (thin metre rule is suitable); supporting blocks; :math:`0.5\text{m}` rule
held by clamp & stand; needle & plasticene; scale pan with loop; 3
:math:`\times` :math:`100\text{g}` and 1 :math:`\times` :math:`50\text{g}` masses; 1 sheet graph
paper.

The aim of this experiment is to determine the Young's modulus of the
material of the bar. Proceed as follows:

(a) Place the wooden bar symmetrically on the supports **A** and **B**.
    Keep the distance :math:`L` between the blocks about :math:`90\text{cm}`. Record
    the distance :math:`L`, and this should not be changed during the
    experiment; also ensure that the protruding lengths of the bar are
    equal. The vertical metre rule should be placed in line with the
    centre of the bar. The pointer needle is attached to the bar at its
    center. Record the pointer reading on the vertical metre rule when
    the bar is unloaded, and call this reading :math:`X_0`. (2 marks)

    With mass :math:`m`, say :math:`50\text{g}`  on the scale pan, record the resulting
    pointer reading :math:`X` on the vertical metre rule, and hence 
    determine the sag, :math:`s = X - X_0`. Repeat this procedure for 5 
    other readings of :math:`m` (see diagram). (10 marks)

(b) Measure the breadth :math:`b` and thickness :math:`d` of the bar. (8
    marks)

(c) Plot a graph of :math:`m` vs. :math:`s`. (10 marks)

(d) Calculate the Young's modulus, :math:`E`, of the bar given that:

    .. math::
       E =\frac{g L^3 m}{4 b d^3 s} \qquad \text{and} \qquad g = 9.8 \text{ms} ^{-2} 

    (11 marks)
   

(e) 

    (i) State any sources of errors and precautions taken in this
        experiment. (5 marks)  

    (ii) Determine the order of accuracy of your results. (4 marks)
