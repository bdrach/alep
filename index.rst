Welcome to ALEP
===============

This website is based off of **Advanced Level Experimental Physics**, a textbook
written by Bob Drach and Norman Price during their time teaching together at the
Ruvuma Boys' Secondary School in Songea, Tanzania.   

The `first edition <_static/alep_original.pdf>`_ was published in 1987.  With the help of Max Drach, we published
the current edition as a `Github project <https://github.com/bdrach/alep>`_
under a `Creative Commons Attribution License
