<h1>Apparatus</h1>
<p>Glass plate with graph paper on the underside; probe; electrodes;
electrode support; 100ml copper sulphate solution; syringe; spirit
level; 4 connecting leads; voltmeter (0-5 &amp; 0-15Vdc); 6V battery; 2
sheets graph paper.</p>

<div class="section" id="procedure">
<h1>Procedure</h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Pour enough copper sulphate solution onto the glass plate to form a
<strong>thin</strong> layer. Level the glass carefully so that the pool is of uniform
depth.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Arrange the apparatus as above, checking that the electrodes are
clean (if necessary clean with sand paper).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">On a sheet of graph paper, mark <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> scales
similar to the sheet under the glass plate. Draw a point and a circle
to show the positions of the electrodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Holding the probe vertically, touch the tip onto the copper sulphate
solution between the electrodes. Move the probe until a point is
found where <span class="math">\(V =\)</span> 1 V. Read the <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>
coordinates. Mark this point on your graph paper.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Find another point about 2cm from the first, where <span class="math">\(V =\)</span> 1 V.
Mark this point on the graph paper. Continue this process until
either the line of points forms a closed loop or goes off the area of
the solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Join the points with a <strong>smooth</strong> curve and label it +1V.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Repeat 4, 5, and 6 with <span class="math">\(V =\)</span> 2V, 3V, and 4V.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Touch the probe onto each electrode in turn, read V, and mark these
values on the graph paper beside the electrodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Change the electrodes to these shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="F1-1.2" src="/static/images/32.png" /></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Draw two parallel lines on a new sheet of graph paper to show these
electrodes. Now repeat steps 4 to 8, but place the probe tip onto
positions in the <strong>whole area</strong> of the copper sulphate solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use the syringe to replace the copper sulphate solution into its
container. Wash the glass plate (top surface only!) then rinse the
electrodes and the probe in clean water.</p>
</li>

<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>The reading on the voltmeter was the value of electric <strong>potential</strong>,
relative to the negative electrode. Thus, the curves that you plotted
were <strong>equipotential lines</strong>, that is lines drawn linking points at the
same electric potential.</p>
<p>If an electric charge moves between points at different electric
potentials, it moves through a <strong>potential difference</strong> (p.d.), and work
is done. If a charge moves perpendicular to an equipotential line, work
is done at a maximum rate (per unit distance), and the charge is moving
along a <strong>line of force</strong>.</p>
<p>A line of force is a line drawn to indicate the direction of the force
on a unit positive charge placed at one of the points on the line. A
charge free to move would move along the line of force, so that work is
done at a maximum rate (per unit distance).</p>
<p>Example: (Note that the lines always cross perpendicularly)</p>

<div class="section" id="analysis">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Sketch on your graph papers the <strong>lines of force</strong>, which are
perpendicular to the equipotential lines (use a different colour
pen).</li>
<li>Use the graph paper obtained in 1 to 8, to find the approximate
potential difference between points <span class="math">\(A\)</span>(9,15) and
<span class="math">\(B\)</span>(8,10).</li>
<li>Calculate the work done if a charge of +2C moves from point <span class="math">\(A\)</span>
to point <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. Describe the energy change if the charge is acted
on by no forces other than that exerted by the electric field.</li>
<li>How much work is done if the +2C charge moves along an equipotential
line?</li>
<li>Look at the pattern of lines of force from steps 1 to 8. What formula
is used to find the force on a charge in this field (in terms of the
size of the charge, the charge on the central electrode, and the
distance from the central electrons)?</li>
<li>Look at the lines of force from step 9. What formula can be used to
find the force on a charge between the electrodes (in terms of p.d.
between the electrodes, distance between electrodes, and the charge)?</li>
<li>Calculate the work done if a -4C charge moves between the electrodes
(from the + to the - electrode), in both of the fields studied.</li>
