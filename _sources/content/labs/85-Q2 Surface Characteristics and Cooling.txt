85-Q2: Surface Characteristics and Cooling
==========================================

Time :math:`1 \frac{1}{2}` hr.

Apparatus
---------

Copper calorimeter with lid; thermometer (0-100°C); stirrer; cardboard
base; stopclock; kerosene or diesel burner; stand and clamp; graduated
beaker; hot water; graph paper.

The aim of this experiment is to investigate how the nature of the
surface of a calorimeter affects the rate of loss of heat. Proceed as
follows:

(a) You are provided with a beaker which is nearly full of hot water and
    a polished copper calorimeter. Nearly fill the calorimeter with the
    hot water, whose temperature should initially be above 80°C, and set
    it up on the bench as illustrated in the figure below.

|85-Q2.1| 

(b) Stir the hot water in the calorimeter constantly and record the
    temperature of the water after every 1.0 minute with the aid of a
    stop clock. Continue recording temperature :math:`\theta` in this
    way for 15 minutes and tabulate :math:`\theta` and time :math:`t`.

(c) Empty the water in the calorimeter into a measuring cylinder and
    record the volume :math:`V`. Blacken the external surface of the
    calorimeter using smoke from the kerosene or diesel burner provided.
    Now pour volume :math:`V` of hot water, whose temperature should
    initially be above 80°C, into the blackened calorimeter and again
    set it up on the bench as illustrated in the figure above.

(d) Repeat the procedure outlined in (b) above. (6 marks)

(e) Using the same axes, plot a cooling curve for the polished
    calorimeter together with its contents and another cooling curve for
    the blackened calorimeter together with its contents. (18 marks)

(f) If :math:`R_p` represents the rate at which the polished calorimeter
    and contents lose heat and :math:`R_b` represents the rate at which
    the blackened calorineter and contents lose heat, determine the
    ratio :math:`\frac{R_p}{R_b}` at:

    (i) 78°C

    (ii) 70°C
