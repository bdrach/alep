<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Construct the following:</p>
<p><img alt="F6-2.1" src="/static/images/55.png" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">Using <span class="math">\(N_p\)</span> = 150 turns, <span class="math">\(N_s\)</span> = 10 turns. Measure and
set <span class="math">\(V_{in} = V_p = 4\)</span>V peak. Measure <span class="math">\(V_s\)</span> peak.
Calculate <span class="math">\(\frac{V_p}{V_s}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\frac{N_p}{N_s}\)</span> and

<li><p class="first">Keeping <span class="math">\(N_p = 150\)</span> turns and <span class="math">\(N_s = 300\)</span> turns, reduce
<span class="math">\(V_{in} = V_p\)</span> to 2V peak. Measure <span class="math">\(V_s\)</span> peak, and
calculate and compare <span class="math">\(\frac{V_p}{V_s}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\frac{N_p}{N_s}\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Remove the clip from the iron cores, and remove one C-core. Place two coils,
one on each arm of a single C-core. Again use <span class="math">\(N_p = 150\)</span> turns and
<span class="math">\(N_s = 300\)</span> turns. Set <span class="math">\(V_{in} = V_p = 4\)</span>V peak.
Measure <span class="math">\(V_s\)</span>.</p>

the 150 turn secondary coil. Connect the CRO to measure <span class="math">\(V_p\)</span>
and adjust <span class="math">\(V_{in}\)</span> so that <span class="math">\(V_p = 4\)</span>V peak.</li>

<div class="section" id="theory">
<h1>Theory</h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Flux <span class="math">\(\Phi\)</span> and induced emf <span class="math">\(E\)</span> are related by the
following:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
E_p &amp;= -N_p \frac{d \Phi_s}{dt} \qquad \qquad \textbf{---- equation A} \\
E_s &amp;= -N_s \frac{d \Phi_p}{dt} \qquad \qquad \textbf{---- equation B}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The unit of flux is the weber - Wb.  When <span class="math">\(\Phi_s\)</span> (the flux through the secondary coil)
<span class="math">\(=\Phi_p\)</span> (the flux through the primary coil), then:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d \Phi_s}{dt} = \frac{d \Phi_p}{dt}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>therefore:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{E_s}{N_s} = \frac{E_p}{N_p}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>thus:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{E_p}{E_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If the resistances of the primary coil and the secondary coil are
both low and the currents flowing through them are not too large,
then:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
V_p \approx E_p \quad \text{and} \quad V_s \approx E_s
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The 10 turn coil is used to detect if the flux <span class="math">\(\Phi\)</span> in the
iron core changes in the experiment. If
<span class="math">\(\Phi = \Phi_{peak} \sin \omega t\)</span>, then equation 1B can be
used to show that <span class="math">\(V_T\)</span> peak <span class="math">\(\propto \Phi_{peak}\)</span>,
provided that <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> is constant.</p>

</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analysis">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Why, in experiment 1a) to 1c), are the two calculated ratios not
exactly equal (hint: use the theory, and the fact that the primary
coil has some resistance)?</li>
<li>Use the theory to explain the result of procedure 1 d).</li>
<li>According to Lenz's Law, the induced current in the secondary coil in
the procedure 2 d) is in such a direction so as to <strong>reduce</strong>
the flux in the core. However procedure 2 f) shows that the flux remains
approximately constant. How is this possible (hint: consider the
primary coil)?</li>
<li>Give an explanation in terms of power flow for the change in
<span class="math">\(I_p\)</span> produced as a result of connecting the 5<span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>
resistor to the secondary coil.</li>
<li><ol class="first loweralpha">
<li>These coils are simple electrical transformers.  What are the causes of
power loss in a transformer, and how can they be minimised?</li>
<li>All electricity supply companies use transformers in their power
distribution systems. Explain, giving reasons, how they are used.</li>
