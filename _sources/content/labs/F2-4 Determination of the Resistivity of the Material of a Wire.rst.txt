  :description: The Wheatstone Bridge uses a know resistor and the ratio of resistance wire segment lengths to determine the resistance in a wire of unknown material.  It's resistivity will reveal the material's identity.

F2-4: Determination of the Resistivity of the Material of a Wire
================================================================

Apparatus
---------

Metre bridge board; resistance wire board (:math:`R_x` - may include
wires of several materials); galvanometer with :math:`100\Omega`
protection resistor; resistor :math:`R_y` of :math:`10\Omega`; :math:`1.5\text{V}`
cell; switch; micrometer screw gauge; jockey (J); connecting leads (3
long, 5 short).    
  
|F2-4.1| 

Procedure
---------

1. Set up the apparatus as above.

2. Close **S**, and place **J** at the :math:`50\text{cm}` mark. Move **J** until the
   galvanometer reads zero. Record the length :math:`\overline{AJ}`.
   Open **S**.

3. Measure the length of :math:`R_x`. Very gently lift the wire
   :math:`R_x` and measure its diameter in 5 different positions.

4. If there are wires of other materials, repeat procedure steps 2 and 3 for
   these wires.

Observations
------------

| **For each wire**  
| Wire description: ________  
| :math:`\overline{AJ}=` ________ cm; 
| :math:`\overline{JB}=` ________ cm; 
| :math:`R_y =` ________ :math:`\Omega`;  
| Length :math:`L` of wire **R**\ = ________ m  
| Diameter of wire **R**: 
| :math:`d_1=` ________ mm; 
| :math:`d_2=` ________ mm; 
| :math:`d_3=` ________ mm; 
| :math:`d_4=` ________ mm;
| :math:`d_5=` ________ mm;
| Average value of :math:`d =` ________ mm.

Theory
------

This circuit is a Wheatstone Bridge. Thus :math:`\frac{\overline{AJ}}{\overline{JB}} = \frac{R_y}{R_x}` and :math:`R_x` can be found.
 
Now :math:`\rho` is the resistivity of the material of the wire, and 
:math:`\rho = \frac{R A}{L}`.  Where here :math:`R = R_x,` :math:`A = \big( \text{cross-sectional area of wire } R_x\big),` and :math:`L = \big(\text{length of } R_x\big)`.

Analysis
--------

1. Use the theory to find :math:`\rho` of the material of each type of
   wire tested.

2. Find a table that shows the resistivity of many types of wire and try to 
   deduce the type of material of each wire. Calculate the % error in each of 
   your results.

3. Choose a suitable material or materials, giving reasons, for the
   construction of the following:  

   a) a fixed resistor of :math:`10000 \Omega`  
   b) a variable resistor of :math:`5 \Omega`  
   c) a lamp filament  
   d) a thermistor  
   e) a junction diode  
   f) a connecting wire  
   g) a long-distance power cable in a National Grid  
   h) a lightning conductor.
