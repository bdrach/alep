About
=====

This website is based off of *Advanced Level Experimental Physics*, a textbook
written by Bob Drach and Norman Price during their time teaching together at
the Ruvuma Boy's Secondary School in Songea, Tanzania.   The first edition
was published in 1987.  In 2016, with the help of Max Drach, we published the
current edition as a Github project under a `Creative Commons Attribution
License <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_.

Find the Github project at https://github.com/bdrach/alep.  The project folder
includes all the text in a markup language so you can edit and compile it
into a format of your choice.  The gh-pages branch contains the version compiled
into html for this website.  To make changes, clone the github repository,
edit the markup, and submit a pull request to the alep repository.
