<div class="section" id="apparatus">
<h1>Apparatus</h1>
<p>2 stands with clamps; metre rule; spiral spring; scale pan with attached
pointer; stopwatch; assorted masses 5g to 100g; 2 sheets of graph paper;
triple beam balance</p>

<h1>Procedure</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Measure and record the mass of the scale pan and attached pointer.
Attach the pan and pointer to one stand and place the metre rule in
the other stand such that the end of the pointer moves lightly over
it. Read and record the pointer position. This is the zero position.</li>
<li>Put 5g in the pan and record the total load (including the mass of
the pan and pointer) and the pointer position.</li>
<li>Put 10g more into the pan and record the position of the pointer and
the total load on the spring. Continue adding 10g increments of mass
until 95g has been added. Record the total load and pointer position
each time.</li>
<li>Once you have reached 95g remove 10g at a time and record the total
load and the pointer position each time. This will give you two
readings for every load except at 95g.</li>
<li>Use the readings in your data table to find the total mean extension
for each load by subtracting the zero position pointer reading (from
1.) from the average pointer reading for each load. Write this in
your table.</li>
<li>Put 50g into the scale pan then set it in vertical oscillations by
lifting it slightly above the equilibrium position then quickly
letting go. Time 20 complete oscillations to find the periodic time,
<span class="math">\(T\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(T = \frac{\text{time for 20 oscillations}}{20}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Repeat procedure (6.) with 100, 150, 200, and 250g. Be certain to
include the mass of the pan and pointer in your tabulation of total
load on the spring.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="observations">
<h1>Observations</h1>
<p>Mass of scale pan and pointer = _____ g</p>
<p>Zero position of pointer = _____ cm (also record in data table)</p>
<p>Tabulate:</p>
<p><img alt="B5-2.2" src="/static/images/14.png" /></p>

<div class="section" id="theory">
<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>Hooke's Law predicts that when the spring experiences elastic
deformation due to a load the extension is linearly proportional to the
load: <span class="math">\(F = -kx\)</span>. When a mass, <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, attached to the spring
extends the spring by a distance, <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, there is a restoring
force <span class="math">\(Mg = \frac{x}{n}g\)</span>, where
<span class="math">\(n = \frac{\text{extension}}{\text{load}}\)</span> (n is the slope of
the first graph you will draw), and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is the acceleration due to
gravity.</p>
<p>The oscillations of the spring are simple harmonic and obey the equation
of motion <span class="math">\(Ma = -\frac{x}{n}g\)</span> or, <span class="math">\(a = -\frac{g}{Mn}x\)</span>.
Using calculus, <span class="math">\(-\frac{a}{x}\)</span> can be expressed in terms of the angular
frequency <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> such that:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\omega^2 = \frac{g}{Mn} \mbox{ and, } T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{Mn}{g}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The above assumes that the spring is weightless. In reality the spring
has an effective mass, <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, which changes the equation for T:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{(M+m)n}{g}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>From a graph (you will draw) of <span class="math">\(T^2\)</span> vs. <span class="math">\(\text{load}\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> can be found:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{T^2}{\text{load}}=\frac{4\pi^2 n}{g}&amp;=\text{(}\text{slope of the second graph} \text{)}\\
g &amp;= 4\pi^2 n \frac{1}{\text{(} \text{slope of the second graph} \text{)}}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-intercept of the <span class="math">\(T^2\)</span> vs. load graph gives the
effective mass, <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, of the spring.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analysis">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Plot a graph of total mean extension vs. load. Find the slope,
<span class="math">\(n\)</span>, of the graph and the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> - intercept. Use SI units.</li>
<li>Does this first graph verify Hooke's Law?</li>
<li>Plot a graph of <span class="math">\(T^2\)</span> vs. load. Fine the slope and the
<span class="math">\(x\)</span> - intercept.</li>
<li>Use the slope of your graph to solve for <span class="math">\(g\)</span>. Does the value
you obtain for <span class="math">\(g\)</span> agree with your expected value of nearly 9.8
ms<span class="math">\(^2\)</span>? If there are differences try to explain them.</li>
<li>What is the value you predict for the effective mass, <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, of the
spring?</li>
