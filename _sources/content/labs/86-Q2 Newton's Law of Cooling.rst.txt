86-Q2: Newton's Law of Cooling
==============================

Time 1\ :math:`\frac{1}{2}` hr.

Apparatus
---------

Thermometer (:math:`0-100\text{°C}`); calorimeter (very small capacity), with lid &
stirrer; cardboard base; stopclock; supply of boiling water; 2 sheets
graph paper; clamp & stand.

The aim of this experiment is to investigate the manner in which a
calorimeter containing hot water cools down.

Procedure
---------

Pour the boiling water into the calorimeter until it is about
three-quarters full, and then set up the calorimeter as illustrated
below. Carefully observe and record the temperature :math:`\Theta\text{°C}`
of the water inside the calorimeter after every two minutes. Continue
the process while stirring the calorimeter until the temperature of the
water drops to about :math:`50\text{°C}`.

|86-Q2.1| 

(a)  Tabulate the values of :math:`\Theta` (in °C) and the
     corresponding values of time :math:`t` (in minutes), starting at
     :math:`t=0`. Also measure and record the room temperature
     :math:`\Theta_R`. (marks 8,4)

(b)  Plot the cooling curve for the calorimeter and its contents using
     the table in (a) above. (10 marks)

(c) Choose six points (:math:`\Theta`, :math:`t`) along the curve in
    (b) above and at each point draw the tangent to the curve and
    then determine the gradient :math:`G` of the curve at that point.
    Calculate and record the excess temperature
    (:math:`\Theta - \Theta_R`) corresponding to each of the six
    points chosen. Hence make up a table that consists of values of
    :math:`G` with corresponding values of (:math:`\Theta - \Theta_R`). (marks 3,6,3)

(d) Using the results of (c) above, draw a graph of "Rate of cooling" 
    vs. "Excess temperature." (10 marks)

(e) Compare the results of (d) above with Newton's Law of Cooling and
    make any relevant comments. (6 marks)
