Assessment of Students' Written Work
====================================

Each group of students should normally present a written report of their
experiment to the teacher within a few days of doing the experiment.

If the teacher has performed the experiment in advance, marking the 8 to
10 scripts is a quick process, particularly if students are encouraged
to write down only those things required by the experiment instructions,
numbering their answers accordingly (This provides some training in exam
technique).

Although each teacher will have their own preferences, the following
is a list of points to look for when marking studentsâ€™ work:

-  **Readings**: Properly tabulated; units in headings; heading names;
   appropriate accuracy; repeated & averaged where necessary; accurate
   calculation and labeling of new quantities (e.g. :math:`\sin x` etc.).

-  **Graph**: Title; scales chosen to spread points diagonally right
   across the paper if possible; axes labels (quantity, unit, scale
   factor, numbers); points (accurately plotted, small o-dot preferred 
   :math:`\odot`, not :math:`\otimes`, etc.); smooth best-fit 
   curve drawn (not a polygon); overall neatness (lines thin, in pencil).

-  **Gradient**: Two points chosen and clearly marked (wide apart), or a
   tangent accurately passing through one point (line should be long).

-  **Y-intercept** (if required): Point clearly marked; must lie on
   paper!

-  **Working**: Algebra clearly laid out showing steps logically;
   correct substitution; (arithmetic details need not be shown); answer
   to sensible number of signigicant figures (3 normally suitable); number in
   scientific notation (:math:`1.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{A}`, or
   :math:`1.3\mu\text{A}`, not :math:`0.0000013\text{A}`).

Generally if an answer to a question is not of a sensible size, the
student should be aware of it and comment accordingly (e.g. if unknown
mass = :math:`3 \times 10^{18}\text{kg}`!). The student could then be given
full credit for correct working based on inaccurate data.

In the exam practicals, the marks shown for each question are for
guidance only, and should not be taken to necessarily be the same as the
exam authority originally allocated.

Answer keys are not provided as in many cases the answers obtained
depend on the particular apparatus or samples used. Be cautious with any 
answer key or sample results that you develop.  These are experiments where 
observation, hypothesis, testing, and questioning are the objectives -- allow 
students to think it out for themselves!
