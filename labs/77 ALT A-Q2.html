<h1 class="title">77 ALT A-Q2: Surface Tensions by Rayleigh's Formula.</h1>
<p>Time <span class="math">\(1 \frac{1}{2}\)</span> hr.</p>
<div class="section" id="apparatus">
<h1>Apparatus</h1>
<p>Beaker of liquid <strong>A</strong>; beaker of liquid <strong>B</strong>; stand and clamp; funnel;
rubber tube; clip; glass tube; measuring cylinder; graph paper;
stopclock; small empty beaker; beam balance.</p>
<p><img alt="77ALTA.Q2-1" src="/static/images/68.png" /></p>
<p>You are required to determine the surface tensions <span class="math">\(\gamma_a\)</span> of
liquid A and <span class="math">\(\gamma_b\)</span> of liquid B. Proceed as follows:</p>
<p>Set up the apparatus shown above. With the clip closed,
fill the funnel with the liquid <strong>A</strong>. Adjust the gripping of the clip
so that the rate of the drops at the lower open end is initially between
20 and 30 drops per minute. When making the adjustments, the drops may
be collected in the measuring cylinder.</p>
<p>Starting with a convenient reading <span class="math">\(V_0\)</span> of the volume of liquid
already collected in the measuring cylinder, observe the new volume
<span class="math">\(V\)</span> of the liquid in the measuring cylinder when a known number
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> of drops have been collected. Without losing the ongoing count
of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, observe six series of pairs of <span class="math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
Tabulate your observations. (6 marks)</p>
<p>Plot a graph of <span class="math">\(V - V_0\)</span> (vertical axis) against <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
(horizontal aXis). (18 marks)</p>
<p>Assuming that the drops are spherical, determine from the resulting
graph the diameter <span class="math">\(d\)</span> and the mass <span class="math">\(m_a\)</span> of one drop. Hence
using Lord Rayleigh's formula:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
m_a = \frac{1.9 d \gamma_a}{\text{g}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <strong>g</strong> is the acceleration due to gravity, which may be taken as
9.8 ms<span class="math">\(^{-2}\)</span>, calculate <span class="math">\(\gamma_a\)</span>. You may assume that the
density of the liquid A is 1.0g cm<span class="math">\(^{-3}\)</span>. (10 marks)</p>
<p>Now empty the entire apparatus and refill it with the liquid <strong>B</strong>.
Adjust the rate of flow as before. Collect 20 drops of the liquid <strong>B</strong>
into the small beaker which you should first weigh empty. Reweigh the
beaker and contents so as to obtain the mass of 20 drops of the liquid.
From your observations, determine the mass m<span class="math">\(_b\)</span> of one drop. (6
marks)</p>
<p>Calculate the surface tension of the liquid <strong>B</strong> given, as before,</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
m_b = \frac{1.9 d \gamma_b}{\text{g}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <strong>g</strong> and <span class="math">\(d\)</span> have the same values as above. (10 marks)</p>
