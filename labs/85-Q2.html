<div class="section" id="apparatus">
<h1>Apparatus</h1>
<p>Copper calorimeter with lid; thermometer (0-100°C); stirrer; cardboard
base; stopclock; kerosene or diesel burner; stand and clamp; graduated
beaker; hot water; graph paper.</p>
<p>The aim of this experiment is to investigate how the nature of the
surface of a calorimeter affects the rate of loss of heat. Proceed as
follows:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>You are provided with a beaker which is nearly full of hot water and
a polished copper calorimeter. Nearly fill the calorimeter with the
hot water, whose temperature should initially be above 80°C, and set
it up on the bench as illustrated in the figure below.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="85-Q2.1" src="/home/sunroom/Dropbox/projects/alep/_html/static/images/72.png" /></p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li>Stir the hot water in the calorimeter constantly and record the
temperature of the water after every 1.0 minute with the aid of a
stop clock. Continue recording temperature <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> in this
way for 15 minutes and tabulate <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> and time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.
(6 Marks)</li>
<li>Empty the water in the calorimeter into a measuring cylinder and
record the volume <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. Blacken the external surface of the
calorimeter using smoke from the kerosene or diesel burner provided.
Now pour volume <span class="math">\(V\)</span> of hot water, whose temperature should
initially be above 80°C, into the blackened calorimeter and again
set it up on the bench as illustrated in the figure above.</li>
<li>Repeat the procedure outlined in (b) above. (6 marks)</li>
<li>Using the same axes, plot a cooling curve for the polished
calorimeter together with its contents and another cooling curve for
the blackened calorimeter together with its contents. (18 marks)</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(R_p\)</span> represents the rate at which the polished calorimeter
and contents lose heat and <span class="math">\(R_b\)</span> represents the rate at which
the blackened calorineter and contents lose heat, determine the
ratio <span class="math">\(\frac{R_p}{R_b}\)</span> at:<ol class="lowerroman">
<li>78°C</li>
<li>70°C</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Comment on your results.</p>
<p>(20 marks)</p>
