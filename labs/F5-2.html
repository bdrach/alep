<h1 class="title">F5-2: Measurement of the Horizontal Component of Earth's Magnetic Field.</h1>
<div class="section" id="apparatus">
<h1>Apparatus</h1>
<p>1.5V Cell; 15<span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> rheostat (approximate); galvanometer with
shunt for O.3-O-O.3 A; mounted coil; magnetic compass; 5 wires (3 long,
2 short); 0.5m ruler.</p>
<p><img alt="F5-2.1" src="static/images/47.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="procedure">
<h1>Procedure</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Set up the apparatus as above, but do not connect the battery. To
avoid errors due to extra magnetic fields, the wires from the coil to
the ammeter &amp; rheostat should be long and twisted together. Arrange
the compass accurately at the centre of the coil.</li>
<li>Turn the plane of the coil so that it lies accurately North-South
(magnetic).</li>
<li>Connect the battery and adjust the rheostat until the compass needle
points NW or NE (at exactly 45° to North). Read the ammeter.</li>
<li>Reverse the battery, and repeat step 3. Average the two readings of
current.</li>
<li>Measure the coil across several diameters. Average these readings and
thus find the average radius of the coil.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="theory">
<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>There are two forces acting on the compass needle:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\tilde{F_E} &amp; \qquad \text{due to the Earth's magnetic field} \\
\tilde{F_C} &amp; \qquad \text{due to the magnetic field of the current}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The compass needle points along the direction of the vector sum of these
two forces.</p>
<p>When <span class="math">\(\tilde{F_C} = 0\)</span>, the needle points North, along
<span class="math">\(\tilde{F_E}\)</span>;</p>
<p>When <span class="math">\(\tilde{F_C} \neq 0\)</span>, then the needle points along the sum
<span class="math">\(\tilde{F_S}\)</span>, as shown on the vector diagram:</p>
<p><img alt="F5-2.2" src="static/images/48.png" /></p>
<p>From the diagram, when <span class="math">\(\theta = 45\)</span>°,
<span class="math">\(\tilde{F_E} = \tilde{F_C}\)</span>. In this case, the magnetic fields of
the coil current and the Earth are equal. The field produced by the coil
current can be calculated from:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\qquad B = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{2 r}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
&amp;B = \text{ magnetic field (tesla -} \tau \text{)} \\
&amp;\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \text{Hm} ^{-1} \\
&amp;N = \text{ number of coil turns} \\
&amp;I = \text{ current (A)} \\
&amp;r = \text{ coil radius (m)}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>In the experiment the magnitude of the field produces by the coil has the same
value as the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analysis">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Calculate the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field.</li>
<li>Draw a diagram of the Earth showing the magnetic lines of force.</li>
<li>Use the diagram to explain why the experiment measures the
<strong>horizontal</strong> component of the field. (Hint: consider the difference
if the experiment is done first in Tanzania, then in Iceland).</li>
<li>If in the experiment, the electric current is doubled, calculate the
angle (from magnetic North) along which the compass needle points.</li>
