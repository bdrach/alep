A1-2: Use of Books and Graph Drawing
====================================

Apparatus
---------

Selection of Physics books; 4 or 5 figure log tables; 1 sheet of graph
paper.

Procedure
---------

1. Use the books provided to answer the following:

   a) What is rectilinear motion?

   b) Name 3 ferromagnetic materials (is there a 4th?).

   c) What are the unit prefixes (letter and name) for:

      :math:`10^{12},\ 10^9,\ 10^6,\ 10^3,\ 10^2,\ 10^{-2}, 10^{-3},\ 10^{-6},\ 10^{-9},\ 10^{-12}`

   d) What are the letters of the Greek alphabet? Give their names.

   e) What does 'Non-Ohmic conductor' mean? Give four examples.

   f) What is the velocity of sound in air at 0°C?

   g) 0°C equals how many K, exactly?

   h) What are the main types of experimental error?

   i) a = :math:`5 \pm 0.005\text{m}` and :math:`b = 3.5 \pm 0.01\text{m}`. What is the error
      in :math:`a+b` in metres and in %? What is the % error in :math:`ab`?

   j) Define the metre, the kilogram, the second, the newton, and the
      joule. Which are base units and why?

2. Use of 4 or 5 figure log tables. Calculate the following:

   a) i)   :math:`28.5 \times 137`
      ii)  :math:`0.056 \times 55.62`
      iii) :math:`0.0335 \div 0.48`

   b) i)    :math:`73500 \div 0.6885`
      ii)   :math:`5.322^4`
      iii)  :math:`\sqrt[3]{6.03}`
      iv)   :math:`\log (0.002)`
      v)    :math:`\sin (26°\ 36')`
      vi)   :math:`\cos^{-1}(0.391)`
      vii)  :math:`\tan (53.552°)`
      viii) :math:`\tan (216°)`
      ix)   :math:`\cos (126°)`

   c) i)  Convert to radians: :math:`\quad 90° \qquad 72° \qquad 200°`
      ii) Convert to degrees: :math:`\quad 1.12\text{rad}  \qquad 3 \pi\text{rad} \qquad 3\pi/2\text{rad}`

   d) i)   :math:`\ln{(7.9)}`
      ii)  :math:`e^{1.5}`
      iii) :math:`\ln (0.14)`
      iv)  :math:`\ln (40)`
      v)   :math:`e^{15}`
      vi)  :math:`e^{0.02}`

   e) i)  :math:`\sqrt{553}`
      ii) :math:`\sqrt{0.07}`

3. Graphs.

   a) In an Ohm's Law experiment, where V = IR, the following
      readings were obtained: 

      |A1-2.1|  

      Draw a graph of V against I, and hence find R.

   b) A cell of internal resistance :math:`r` and emf :math:`E` supplies
      current through a resistor :math:`R`. The equation which applies
      is:

      .. math::
         r=R \left(\frac{E-V}{V}\right)

      Readings of R and V are obtained, and :math:`1/R` is plotted
      against :math:`1/V`. Explain how the gradient and y-intercept can
      be used to find :math:`E` and :math:`r`.
