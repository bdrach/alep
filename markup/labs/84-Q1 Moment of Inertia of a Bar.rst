84-Q1: Moment of Inertia of a Bar
=================================

Time: :math:`1 \frac{1}{2}` hr.

Apparatus
---------

Bifilar pendulum (Wooden bar or metre rule with holes 0.5cm from ends);
2 threads (:math:`\sim` 1.2m long); 2 :math:`\times` 100g masses (flat
bottom to strap to bar); 2 elastic bands; metre rule; stopclock; 2
clamps & stands; 2 G-clamps; piece of chalk; 1 sheet graph paper;
(optional: spirit level).

The aim of this experiment is to determine the moment of inertia,
:math:`I`, of a wooden bar acting as a bifilar pendulum. Proceed as
follows:

(a) Determine the centre of mass :math:`G` of the wooden bar, and draw
    the horizontal axis of the bar (from :math:`B`, through :math:`G`,
    to :math:`D`).

(b) Using the pieces of thread provided, suspend the wooden bar as shown
    above, such that :math:`L = d = CD \approx 100`\ cm. Measure and
    record :math:`L` and :math:`d`. (2 marks)

(c) Make adjustments so that the bar is horizontal.

(d) Measure distance :math:`x = 5`\ cm from each side of :math:`G` to
    the variable positions :math:`P` and :math:`Q` as shown above.

(e) Place the 100g masses at positions :math:`P` and :math:`Q`
    simultaneously. Set the wooden bar oscillating about a vertical axis
    through :math:`G`. Record the time :math:`t` for 10 complete
    oscillations and calculate the correspondinb periodic time
    :math:`T`. (2 marks)

(f) Move the 100g masses along the wooden bar at increasing distance
    :math:`x` in intervals of 5cm from each side of :math:`G`. At each
    stage, measure the time :math:`t` for 10 complete oscillations and
    determine the corresponding periodic time :math:`T`. Tabulate your
    results. (10 marks)

(g) Plot a graph of :math:`T^2` (vertical axis) against :math:`x^2`
    (horizontal axis). (marks: table 3, graph 12)

(h) Given that:

    .. math::
       T^2 = \frac{16 \pi ^2 I L}{(M + m) g d^2} + \frac{16 \pi ^2 m L x^2}{(M + m) g d^2}

    Use your graph to determine :math:`I` and :math:`M`; where :math:`L` and
    :math:`d` are expressed in SI units. :math:`g=9.81` ms\ :math:`^{-2}`.
    :math:`m=0.2`\ kg. What does :math:`M` represent? (marks: use of graph
    5, :math:`I \text{ and } M` 10, :math:`M` represents? 2)

(i) Mention any precautions that you took in performing this
    experiment. (4 marks)
