:title: Ohmic and Non-Ohmic Conductors
:id: F2-2
:description: Many conductors behave consistent with Ohm's Law, :math:`V=IR'.Other materials may conduct current in only one direction, or otherwise varyfrom Ohm's law.  Exploiting these known varriances can be quite useful.

F2-2: Ohmic and Non-Ohmic Conductors
====================================

Apparatus
---------

3V battery; galvanometer with shunt for 0.3-0-0.3 A; voltmeter (0-3Vdc);
resistance box; switch; block with crocodile clips to hold component; 7
connecting leads; 1 sheet graph paper.

**Components under test:**  A. Resistance wire   B. 6V bulb in holder   C.
Copper Sulphate solution with copper electrodes   D. Semiconductor diode

|F2-2.1| 

Procedure
---------

1. Set up the circuit as above, using component A.

2. Set the resistance box to 5\ :math:`\Omega`, close the switch, and
   read :math:`V` and :math:`I`.

3. Increase the resistance box resistance to 10, 20, 50\ :math:`\Omega`,
   and then :math:`\infty\Omega`, in each case reading :math:`V` and
   :math:`I`. Tabulate the readings of :math:`V` and :math:`I`.

4. Reverse the connections to the component. Repeat steps 2 and 3,
   recording the values of :math:`V` and :math:`I` as NEGATIVE values.

5. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4, using components B, C, and D in turn.  Note
   that the diode should first be connected into the circuit as follows:

   |F2-2.2|

Analysis
--------

1. Plot all the readings on the same sheet of graph paper, labelling the
   lines carefully (:math:`V` vs. :math:`I`).

2. Calculate resistance from lines where :math:`V \propto I`.

3. The lines on your graph all follow different paths. For each of the
   conductors in turn, explain why the line for the conductor has the
   shape it does (You should refer to the internal structure and
   properties of the component when you answer this, and use text books
   for reference).

Questions
---------

1. What are the properties required of a material used to make
   resistors?

2. Draw a circuit to show how semiconductor diodes can be used to
   rectify an AC supply.

3. Why does a tungsten-filament bulb have such a low efficiency?

4. Find the resistance of the shunt in parallel with the galvanometer if
   the galvanometer alone has a full-scale deflection of 3mA, and an
   internal resistance of 10\ :math:`\Omega`.
