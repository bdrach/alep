<div class="section" id="apparatus">
<h1>Apparatus</h1>
<p>Magnets mounted on a soft iron core; rectangular copper wire coil;
mounted razor blades; plastic dampening stick; 5 connecting wires; 1.5V
dry cell; key switch; 15<span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> rheostat; ammeter with 0 to
0.3mA scale; metre stick; callipers; triple beam balance; 5m of ticker
tape; about 0.4m piece of extra ticker tape; tweezers; scissors.</p>

<h1>Procedure</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Set up the apparatus as shown above. Be certain the wire coil is
level with the smooth end of the coil in the exact center of the
magnetic field.</li>
<li>Measure and record the horizontal length of the magnets. Neglecting
edge effects, this is the length of the magnetic field the current
passes through.</li>
<li>Measure and record the mass of 5m of ticker tape. Use this to
determine the linear density <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> of the tape.</li>
<li>Place the key in the switch and allow 0.05mA of current to pass
through the circuit by adjusting the rheostat. The end of the coil
between the magnets should deflect down. If the end of the coil
between the magnet deflects up, reverse the direction of the dry cell
in the circuit to make the end of the coil between the magnets
deflect down. From the short extra piece of ticker tape, cut lengths
of tape 0 to 4cm long, fold them in half, and using the tweezers
place them on the end of the coil opposite the magnets. Add or remove
tape until the coil is again level.</li>
<li>When the weight of the tape pieces balances the force on the current
carrying end of the wire, switch the current off and remove the
pieces of tape. Measure the lenth of this tape and using <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>,
determine the weight of the pieces of tape.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 4 and 5 above for currents 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, and
0.30mA. Calculate your results.</li>

<div class="section" id="theory">
<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>For a current flowing perpendicular to a magnetic field, the force
exerted on the current carrier is <span class="math">\(F = B I L\)</span> where <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is
in newtons, <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is in tesla, <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is in amperes, and
<span class="math">\(L\)</span> is the length in metres of the wire in the magnetic field.</p>
<p>In this experiment, the coil experiences a torque due to the force on
the end of the wire which runs through the magnetic field.
<span class="math">\(\tau = F R\)</span> where <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is the distance from the end of the
coil to the pivot on the razor blades. The coil is uniform and the
distance, <span class="math">\(R\)</span> to each end is the same.</p>
<p>When the coil is level, the weight of the tape on one end is equal to
the force of the magnetic field on the current at the other end of the
coil. The magnetic flux density is found from:
<span class="math">\(B = \frac{F}{I L} = \frac{W}{I L}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analysis">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Use your measurements to find the magnetic flux density of the magnet
for each value of <span class="math">\(I\)</span> and then find an average value for
<span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Explain why the end of the coil in the magnetic field is deflected
down when the current is increased.</p>
<p>Use your text or research the topic &quot;torque on a current loop&quot; online as
a reference for your answer.</p>
