<h1 class="title">E3-1: Finding the Wavelength of Sodium Light Using a Diffraction Grating and Spectrometer</h1>
<div class="section" id="apparatus">
<h1>Apparatus</h1>
<p><em>NB: A darkened room is required.</em></p>
<p>Spectrometer (set up and adjusted); diffraction grating; glass screen;
candle in holder; matches; wire loop and a Sodium salt</p>
<p><img alt="E3-1.1" src="/home/sunroom/Dropbox/projects/alep/_html/static/images/29.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="procedure">
<h1>Procedure</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Essential precautions: Do not touch the collimator or telescope
lenses or the glass of the diffraction grating. Keep the glass screen
between the candle flame and the slit. Take care with this delicate
apparatus.</li>
<li>Without the diffraction grating on the table, place the telescope at
<span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Adjust focusing and candle position until the slit is visible
through the telescope.</li>
<li>Replace the diffraction grating as above. The slit should still be visible
through the telescope. Move the telescope towards <span class="math">\(B\)</span> until a
spectrum is seen. If none is seen, check that little direct light is
falling on the apparatus. Otherwise seek help.</li>
<li>Burn some Sodium salt in the candle flame using the wire loop. Move
the telescope to place the cross-wires on the bright yellow (Sodium)
lines. Read the angle on one of the vernier scales <span class="math">\(\Theta_1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Move the telescope towards <span class="math">\(C\)</span>. Repeat step 4., reading the
angle from the <strong>same</strong> vernier scale <span class="math">\(\Theta_2\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="observations">
<h1>Observations</h1>
<p>In the below diagram, you are to measure <span class="math">\(\Theta\)</span> both above and below the
central bright line <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\Theta_1 =\)</span> ____° ____'</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\Theta_2 =\)</span> ____° ____'</p>
<p><img alt="E3-1.2" src="/home/sunroom/Dropbox/projects/alep/_html/static/images/30.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="theory">
<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>In the above diagram:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
C &amp;= \text{central bright line} \\
F &amp;= \text{first order spectra} \text{ (}n=1 \text{)} \\
S &amp;= \text{second order spectra} \text{ (}n=2 \text{)} \\
\Theta &amp;= \text{angle of } \text{ } F \text{ } \text{from} \text{ } C
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>From the readings:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\qquad \Theta = \frac{\Theta_2 - \Theta_1}{2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Take care to calculate <span class="math">\(\Theta\)</span> correctly if your vernier scale
moved through 0° when moving from <span class="math">\(\Theta_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\Theta_2\)</span> .</p>
<p>The spectrometer apparatus takes advantage of the fact that the wavelength (
<span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>) of Sodium light is diffracted from a straight path by the
small openings in the diffraction grating, and the relationship between the
size of the grating, the wavelength of light, and the angle of diffraction
follows a known equation.  Then:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\qquad \lambda = \frac{d \sin \Theta}{n}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analysis">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>Use your observations and the theory to find the <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> of
Sodium light. Use your text or assigned reading on spectrometry of light.
Find <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> of sodium light from your research and compare this with
your value from the experiment. Use the average <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> of the two brightest yellow
lines that you observed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="questions">
<h1>Questions</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Why did you see the Sodium spectrum <strong>and</strong> a continuous spectrum?</li>
<li>Calculate the energy of a photon of yellow light from hot sodium.
(<span class="math">\(h 6.6 \times 10^-34 \)</span>).</li>
<li>An electric Sodium lamp rated at 40W is approximately 20% efficient
in producing visible light. Assuming that all the light produced is
at the wavelength you calculated above, how many photons per second
are given out by the lamp?</li>
<li>Draw a diagram to illustrate the change in energy state of a Sodium
atom when emitting a photon of yellow light. If the lower energy
state is <span class="math">\(x\)</span> eV, what is the upper energy state in eV?
(<span class="math">\(e = 1.6 \times 10^-19\)</span> C).</li>
