A1-1: Measurements and Accuracy
===============================

Apparatus
---------

Microscope slide; vernier calipers; magnifying glass; micrometer; beam
balance with masses; Archimedes' bridge; beaker of water (250ml); metre
ruler.

Procedure
---------

For each of the following, record the observations together with the
possible error (i.e.: Â½ the smallest scale division), e.g.:
:math:`46 \pm 0.5` mm. Calculate the mean value of repeated readings
together with the error. Calculate the % error.

1. Measure the slide thickness in a number of places using the metre
   ruler.

2. Repeat using the vernier calipers instead.

3. Measure the slide thickness in several places using the micrometer. 
   For a mechanical micrometer, record the 'zero reading' and adjust the other 
   readings correctly.

4. Measure the length :math:`l` and the width :math:`w` using the metre
   ruler. Find the mass of the slide in air :math:`m`\ , and then its 
   apparent mass when suspended in water :math:`m_a`.

Then:

.. math::
   \text{upthrust} &= \text{weight of liquid displaced}   \\
   mg - m_a g &= \rho_w g \ [\text{slide volume}]

where:

.. math::
   \text{slide volume} = \frac{m - m_a}{\rho_w} \\
    \rho_w = \text{density of water}

.. %ALTERNATIVE NOTATION SAMPLE FOR ABOVE LINE mg - m_a g &= \rho_w g (\text{slide volume}) \\ 

Then calculate the slide thickness :math:`d` since:

.. math::
   l w d = \text{slide volume}

When you have completed the above, arrange the estimates of slide
thickness in order (most accurate first).

Explain carefully why some methods are more accurate than others.
