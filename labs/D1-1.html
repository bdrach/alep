<div class="section" id="apparatus">
<h1>Apparatus</h1>
<p>Gas burner or a stove; heating stand; steam generator; expansion sample;
small beaker or dish; meter stick; micrometer; thermometer; stack of
books, table of linear expansivities of common materials</p>

<div class="section" id="procedure">
<h1>Procedure</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Set up apparatus as shown above. Be sure the sample slopes away from
the steam generator, screw #1 is very tight, and screw #3 is very
loose. Be certain there is water in the steam generator.</li>
<li>Loosen screw #2 and push the sliding metal piece up against the leg
which holds the sample. Tighten screw #2 to lock the sliding metal
piece in this position. Measure the distance <span class="math">\(AB\)</span> with a
micrometer. NOTE: The metal faces at <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are not
perfectly flat or parallel. You must measure <span class="math">\(AB\)</span> at the very
edge of the metal pieces and then use the exact same location for all
future measurements.</li>
<li>Measure the length, <span class="math">\(L_0\)</span>,of the sample. Measure from the
centers of the tightened screws #1 and #2.</li>
<li>Measure the room temperature.</li>
<li>Light the gas burner or stove. After steam begins flowing steadily
through the tube wait 3 minutes and then measure <span class="math">\(AB\)</span> again.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="observations">
<h1>Observations</h1>
<p><span class="math">\(AB\)</span> before heating = ____ m, <span class="math">\(AB\)</span> after heating =
____ m</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\Delta L\)</span> = change in length = ____ m</p>
<p><span class="math">\(L_0\)</span> = length of sample between screws 1 and 2 = ____ m</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\Theta_T\)</span> = room temperature = ____<span class="math">\(^0\)</span> C</p>

____<span class="math">\(^0\)</span> C</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="theory">
<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>The coefficient of linear expansion is determined from the relation
<span class="math">\(\Delta L = L_0 \alpha \Delta \Theta\)</span> where <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is the
average of the coefficient of linear expansion over the temperature
range.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analysis">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What is the coefficient of linear expansion of the sample?</li>
<li>What material is the sample? Explain your choice by refering to a
table of linear expansivities of common materials.</li>
<li>List 4 assumptions you made in determining the coefficient for the
sample. For each assumption justify it or account for error.</li>
