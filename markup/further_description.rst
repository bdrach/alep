Further Description of Apparatus for Teachers and Technicians
=============================================================

**Practical Exercises:**

**A1-1** A large model of a vernier scale can help students.  For the 
Archimede's bridge, use any mechanism such that the student can suspend 
the microscope slide in the beaker and take the apparent weight measurement
using the beam balance.

**A1-2** Ensure that the books supplied to students contain all the required
information.

**B1-1** None

**B1-2** Unknown mass should be about 250g.

**B3-1** Height 'PR' should not exceed 10cm to avoid sliding of the axel.

**B5-1** Stick should be about 1.2m long with 16 equally spaced holes.

**B5-2** A spring of mass 6g will have an effective mass, m, of 2g.  For a
larger spring the effective mass will be greater.

**B5-3** None

**C1-1** Sulfuric acid and caustic soda are suitable dilute acid and
alkaline.

**C2-1** Other liquids, for example kerosene, may be tried but will rot the
rubber tubing.

**C3-1** Expected value for the Young's modulus along the grain is about
10GPa.

**C3-2** Magnifying glass is to help see the vernier scale.  An old callipers
glued to a wood strip makes a good mounted vernier scale.

**C3-3** Ensure that the books supplied contain the required information.  
Supply the students with a box of many different materials which may be
tested to destruction and a separate box of materials to be tested
labled 'Do not damage' containing samples to be kept intact.

**D1-1** The expansion sample is a hollow tube mounted in large metal
blocks.  Screws 1 and 2 fix the sample in the blocks.  Screw 3 fixes the
travelling block to the stationary block.

**D2-1** A wooden calorimeter lid can be drilled to accept a rubber bung.  
The central wire should be in a glass tube through the bung extending to
the bottom of the heater to avoid a short circuit.  The right-hand wire
should go through a glass tube through the bung to avoid melting the
rubber.  Uninsulated Nichrome resistance wire (Resistance about
1\ :math:`\Omega`) is suitable and should be as thick as possible.  The
wires can be brought out to two connectors fixed to the top of the
wooden lid.  In the 'Theory' section, the theory of 'cooling correction' can
be researched further online or may be in your local physics texts.

**E1-1** If the sonometer has no force meter, a spring balance can be
fitted.  The meter should be recalibrated in newtons if it reads grams.  A
sticker should be put nearby giving the maximum safe tension for the
wire (eg. "25N maximum").  Experiment 1, step 3, may need demonstrating
if "same note" is not understood.  A sounding box can be any hollow
wooden box.

**E3-1** The spectrometer should be set up in advance of each session.  The
candle could be replaced by a sodium lamp if one is available.  A
darkened room is required but total darkness is unnecessary.  Make certain 
a suitable section on spectrometry is in the class text, or you supply
supplemental materials that include the known wavelength of Sodium light.

**F1-1** Glass plate:

|F1-1.a| 

Electrodes are made of thick copper wire soldered at joints.  The
circular electrode shoud be about 8cm in diameter.  The electrode support
is a thin wooden strip on two wooden blocks.

**F1-2** Other large value capacitors are suitable (eg.
2000\ :math:`\mu`\ F, etc.).  Do not use less than
500\ :math:`\mu`\ F.  The ammeter can be a galvanometer with a
suitable resistance wire shunt.  Note that many capacitors are accurate
:math:`\pm 10 \%` and results will reflect this.

**F2-1** A Daniell cell could be substituted.

**F2-2** Use a resistance wire for the galvanometer shunt.  Resistors can be
substituted for the resistance box.  Block with crocodile clips to hold
the components can be included with the apparatus.

|F3-2.2| 

The components: A) resistance of about 5\ :math:`\Omega`, B) 6V bulb
preferably 0.5A type, C) ensure the electrodes are clean, D) any
semiconductor diode is suitable.

**F2-3** For the resistor, use copper wire (36SWG enamelled is suitable)
wound onto a strip of cardboard and placed inside the test tube.  Use
about 15m of wire to give a resistance of about 10\ :math:`\Omega`.  
Solder insulated stranded copper wire onto the thin copper wire with the
joints inside of the test tube.  Make cuts in the rubber bung to allow
the insulated wire to exit the tube.  The thermometer with a scale 0°C to
100°C should also pass through the bung.

**F2-4** A range of different material, length and thickness wire for
:math:`R_x` can be mounted on the same board. Provide at least three
different wires to test as :math:`R_x`.

**F5-1** Thick copper wire formed into a rectangle 35cm long and 1cm wider
than the magnets works well as the coil.  Be certain the coil does not
make a closed circuit through the end opposite to the magnets.  For
question 2 of the analysis, a text available to the students should be
provided.  The authors have used *Advanced Level Physics* by Nelkon and Parker 
(fourth edition), pp 775-776, or *University I Physics* by Sears, Zamansky, 
and Young (fifth edition) pp 725-728 as a reference.

**F5-2** The mounted coil can be easily constructed from 10 turns of stiff
copper wire bound with insulating tape, placed in a slot cut in a wooden
board.  The coil must not be fixed to the board, this to allow
substitution of different coils.  The board needs legs to support it
above the bench.

**F6-1** 300 turn coil: 36SWG copper on a cardboard former to be removeable
from C-core.  Solder on stranded insulated copper wires for connection,
and cover the 36SWG wire with insulating tape.  Students will need help
operating the CRO.  An AC voltmeter could be substituted for the CRO but
the students will learn less, and the readings will be rms.

**F6-2** 300 turn and 150 turn coils constructed as in F6-1.

**G1-1** For the ammeter, a multimeter or two ammeters of different ranges
can be used.  The triode specified, TEL521, from Teltron LTD., London,
works well but any triod with clearly labeled connections is also
suitable. 

**G2-1** Microammeter can be a Nakamura galvanometer (2.5 :math:`\mu`\ A
per division) and the milliameter can be a Weir galvanometer (3mA full scale
deflection (*fsd*)).  Rheostats 1k\ :math:`\Omega` to 10k\ :math:`\Omega` are
preferred.  A 15\ :math:`\Omega` rheostat is useable but it will run down
batteries quickly.

| Some common pnp transistors (view of underside): |G2-1.a|
|  Testing old transistors:  
| Using: |G2-1.b|

1) Find two wires of the transistor with no conduction in either
direction.  The base wire is the other wire.  (Failure to find this:
transistor broken)  

2) With Base +, another wire -: conduction means that the transistor
is npn.  

| 3) With base -, another wire +: conduction means that the transistor is pnp.  

| 4) If there is conduction in both cases, the transistor is broken.

5) To distinguish **C** and **E** is difficult. Try the experiment G2-1.  If 
:math:`\beta >40` then the choice of **C** and **E** made was probably correct.

Nb: npn transistors can easily be used in the experiment but the battery
connections must be reversed.

**H3-1** Wooden cubes are easily made (edges about 1cm each). Ensure edges
are clean and even and mark the symbols :math:`\odot` and
:math:`\otimes` on opposite faces (leaving 4 blank faces).

**PAST EXAM PAPERS:**

**77ALTA-Q2** A heavy weight must be placed on the base of the stand or it
will topple over. Both liquid **A** and liquid **B** are water. Add
some Potassium Permanganate (:math:`KMnO_4`) to liqiud **B** to raise an
element of doubt for the students.

**80ALTB-Q1** Prisms may be placed on **A** and **B**. Expected value of the
Young's modulus is about 14GPa.

**84-Q1** None

**85-Q1** None

**85-Q2** Have a thermos flask for the hot water. Pliers are useful for
holding the calorimeter over the stove when blackening it.

**86-Q2** A small (25cm:math:`^3`) calorimeter is essential to ensure a
measureable change in the rate of cooling.

**86-Q3** None

**87-Q1** The burette or cylinder must have a diameter of :math:`\ge 3`\ cm
to avoid surface effects and must :math:`\ge 30`\ cm deep. Liquid **L**
is engine oil, SAE 40. Typical values for :math:`\rho_1` and
:math:`\rho_2` are 8800kgm\ :math:`^{-3}` and 900kgm\ :math:`^{-3}`.

**General:**

Battery boxes: It is worthwhile to construct a good number ranging from
1 cell to 6 cell capacity.

Connecting leads: A large number are needed, if possible with crocodile
clips and/or plugs, made of stranded insulated wire (standard useful
lengths are 40cm and 60cm).
