85-Q1: Relative Density of a Liquid
===================================

Time: :math:`1 \frac{1}{2}` hr.

Apparatus
---------

Metre rule; thread (:math:`\approx 50\text{cm}`.; fulcrum (eg. prism); fulcrum
support (height :math:`\approx` :math:`10\text{cm}`; :math:`L_1` :math:`200\text{ml}` water in :math:`250\text{m}`
beaker; :math:`L_2` :math:`200\text{ml}` motor oil (or kerosene) in :math:`250\text{ml}` beaker;
:math:`W_1` :math:`50\text{g}` mass (metal); :math:`W_2` :math:`20\text{g}` mass (plastic or rubber);
piece of chalk; 2 sheets graph paper.

In this experiment you are required to determine the density of liquid
:math:`L_2` relative to that of liquid :math:`L_1`, and find the mass
:math:`M` of the metre rule provided. Proceed as follows:

(a) Locate and mark the centre of gravity :math:`G` of the metre rule.

(b) Set up the apparatus as illustrated below, where :math:`a = 5`\ cm,
    and :math:`W_1` and :math:`W2` are masses of :math:`50\text{g}` and 20g
    respectively.

(c) With :math:`W_2` totally immersed in liquid :math:`L_1` and
    :math:`x = 10\text{cm}`, balance the metre rule by adjusting the position
    of :math:`W_1`. Read and record distance :math:`y`. Repeat the
    process for :math:`X = 20\text{cm}, 30\text{cm}, 40\text{cm}, 50\text{cm}, \text{ and } 54\text{cm}`. Tabulate
    the values of :math:`x` and :math:`y`. (7 marks)

(d) Replace liquid :math:`L_1` by liquid :math:`L_2` and then repeat the
    procedure outlined in (c) above. (7 marks)

(e) Plot a graph of :math:`y` vs. :math:`x` using the table obtained in
    (c): (8 marks)

(f) Read and record :math:`I`, the value of :math:`y` when
    :math:`x = 0`. Calculate :math:`10 \times I`, which is equal to the
    mass of the metre rule. (4 marks)

    (ii)  Find the slope :math:`S_1` of the graph. (4 marks)

    (iii) Find the value of :math:`\lambda _1` given that :math:`\lambda_1 = 0.4 - S_1`. (2 marks)

(f) Plot a graph of :math:`y` against :math:`x` using the table obtained
    in (d). (8 marks)

(g) Find the slope :math:`S_2` of this graph. (4 marks)

    (ii)  Find the value of :math:`\lambda _2` given that
          :math:`\lambda _2 = 0.4 - S_2`. (2 marks)

    (iii) Evaluate the ratio :math:`\frac{\lambda _2}{\lambda _1}`, which is
          equal te the density of liquid :math:`L_2` relative to that of
          liquid :math:`L_1`. (4 marks)
