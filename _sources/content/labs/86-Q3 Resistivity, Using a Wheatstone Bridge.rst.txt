86-Q3: Resistivity, Using a Wheatstone Bridge
=============================================

Time 1\ :math:`\frac{1}{2}` hr.

Apparatus
---------

Metre bridge & jockey; resistance wire (length :math:`\approx` :math:`1\text{m}`,
resistance :math:`\approx 2 \Omega` but not less); metre rule; resistors
(:math:`0.5\Omega, 1\Omega, 2\times 2\Omega, 5\Omega, 10\Omega, 20\Omega`); :math:`1.5\text{V}` cell;
galvanometer; 4 connecting leads (3 long, 1 short); 1 sheet graph paper;
micrometer.

The aim of this experiment is to determine the electrical resistivity of
the wire provided. Proceed as follows:

(a) Set up a slide-wire metre bridge as illustrated below where **E** is
    a cell, **G** is a Galvanometer, length :math:`l` of the resistance
    wire is connected across the right-hand gap of the bridge, and the
    jockey or slider **J** is placed at the 50\text{cm}` mark.

(b) With **R** :math:`= 20 \Omega`, find the value of length :math:`l` for
    which the galvanometer gives zero deflection when the slider is
    tapped onto the 50\text{cm}` mark as shown below. (2 marks)

(c) Repeat the procedure in (b) for values of **R** equal to
    :math:`10\Omega, 5\Omega, 2\Omega, 1 \Omega, \text{ and } 0.5 \Omega`. (8 marks)

(i)   Calculate and tabulate the values of
      :math:`\frac{1}{R} \text{ and } \frac{1}{l}` for the values of
      :math:`R` equal to :math:`20\Omega, 10\Omega,
      5\Omega, 2\Omega, 1\Omega, \text{ and } 0.5\Omega` obtained in (b) and (c) above. (7 marks)

(ii)  By means of the micrometer screw gauge provided, measure the
      diameter of the resistance wire, and hence calculate its average
      diameter :math:`d`. (5 marks)

(iii) Plot a graph of :math:`\frac{1}{R} \text{ vs. } \frac{1}{l}`
      (whose values are recorded in i above) and determine the gradient. (12,
      5 marks)

(iv)  Determine the resistivity :math:`\rho` of the resistance wire
      given that:

      .. math::
         
         \frac{1}{R} = \frac{A}{\rho} \frac{1}{l} - \frac{1}{2}
         

      Where :math:`A` is the cross-sectional area of the resistance
      wire. (4, 7 marks)
